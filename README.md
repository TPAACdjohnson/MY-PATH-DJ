# 🎮 MY PATH: A CHOOSE-YOUR-ADVENTURE JOURNEY OF TRUTH

**Created by Rev. Darryl Johnson, PsyM, CA, CSM**  
_A project of The Path: An Agent of Change, Inc._

## 📖 About the Game

**MY PATH** is an interactive, narrative-driven game based entirely on the true story of Rev. Darryl Johnson—a Black boy raised by a single NYPD mother, later becoming a Navy air traffic controller, spiritual healer, and social change architect. Each choice reflects real trauma, real survival, and real transformation.

Players step into his shoes and walk the winding road of his life—one decision at a time. What begins in Brooklyn, NY, stretches across Georgia, into the military, and beyond into deep spiritual awakening and purpose.

This game is not fiction.  
It is survival.  
It is testimony.  
It is strategy.  
It is truth.
